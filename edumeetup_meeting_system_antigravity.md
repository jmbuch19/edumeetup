## SECTION 5: VIDEO LINK LOGIC

**University sets preference in Availability setup. Logic:**

```
IF video_provider = "Google Meet":
  → On Meeting Confirmed:
     Create Google Calendar event via Google Calendar API
     (Use service account with delegated access)
     Auto-generates Meet link
     Sends calendar invite to student email + rep email
     Stores Meet link in Meeting Request → video_link

IF video_provider = "Zoom":
  → On Meeting Confirmed:
     Call Zoom API: Create Meeting
     (Under licensed host account)
     Store zoom join URL in Meeting Request → video_link
     Store zoom meeting ID/password if applicable

IF video_provider = "External Link":
  → University has pre-set a permanent link in Availability
  → On Meeting Confirmed:
     Copy that link to Meeting Request → video_link
     (No API call needed)
  → Display note to student:
     "Join via the link below. Your host will let you in at the scheduled time."
```

**Fallback if API fails:**
- Set video_link = "Link will be shared 30 minutes before meeting"
- Send email manually prompt to university rep

> Schedule these as recurring backend jobs

---

### Workflow 1: Send Reminders (run every 15 minutes)

```
Search Meeting Requests where:
  status = Confirmed
  confirmed_datetime is between NOW and NOW + 24h 10min

For each result:

  IF confirmed_datetime between NOW+23h50m and NOW+24h10m
     AND reminder_24h_sent = no:
       → Send 24h reminder to student + rep
       → Set reminder_24h_sent = yes

  IF confirmed_datetime between NOW+50m and NOW+70m
     AND reminder_1h_sent = no:
       → Send 1h reminder to student + rep
       → Set reminder_1h_sent = yes

  IF confirmed_datetime between NOW-1m and NOW+11m
     AND reminder_10min_sent = no:
       → Send 10min reminder to student + rep
       → Set reminder_10min_sent = yes
```

---

### Workflow 2: Mark Completed (run every 15 minutes)

```
Search Meeting Requests where:
  status = Confirmed
  confirmed_datetime + duration_minutes + 15min < NOW

For each result:
  → Update status = Completed
  → Send feedback request to student
  → Send post-meeting notes prompt to university rep
```

---

### Workflow 3: Flag No Shows (run every 15 minutes)

```
Search Meeting Requests where:
  status = Confirmed
  confirmed_datetime + 15min < NOW
  (meeting should have started 15 min ago but still Confirmed)

For each result:
  → Update status = No Show
  → Log in Notification Log
  → Send alert to admin
```

---

### Workflow 4: Daily Admin Summary (run daily at 6pm)

```
Count Meeting Requests where created_at = today → New bookings
Count Meeting Requests where status changed to Confirmed today → Confirmed
Count Meeting Requests where status = Cancelled AND cancelled_at = today → Cancellations
Count Meeting Requests where status = Completed AND last_updated = today → Completed
Count Meeting Requests where status = No Show AND last_updated = today → No Shows

Send email to jaydeep@edumeetup.com with these stats
```

---

## SECTION 8: DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS

### Meeting Booking Flow (4 steps):
- Progress indicator at top: Step 1 of 4 with step names
- Each step is a separate screen (not all on one page)
- Back button always available
- Data from previous steps preserved when going back
- No data saved until final Confirm click

### Status Badge Colors:
```
PENDING         → Yellow  #F59E0B  "Awaiting Confirmation"
CONFIRMED       → Green   #10B981  "Confirmed ✅"
RESCHEDULE      → Blue    #3B82F6  "New Time Proposed"
CANCELLED       → Red     #EF4444  "Cancelled"
COMPLETED       → Gray    #6B7280  "Completed"
NO SHOW         → Dark    #374151  "No Show"
```

### JOIN Button States:
```
> 10 min before start   → Gray,    disabled,  shows "Joins in [countdown]"
= 10 min before start   → Green,   active,    shows "Join Meeting ▶"
During meeting          → Green,   active,    shows "Join Now ▶ (In Progress)"
After meeting end       → Gray,    disabled,  shows "Meeting Ended"
```

### Time Display Rule (always show both):
```
Student pages → Student's timezone PRIMARY, rep timezone in brackets
University pages → Rep's timezone PRIMARY, student timezone in brackets
Example: "3:00 PM IST (9:30 AM EST)"
```

### Mobile Optimizations:
- Booking steps: full screen on mobile, no sidebars
- Meeting cards: vertically stacked, large touch targets
- JOIN button: full width, minimum 56px height
- Calendar view: week view default on mobile (not month)
- Time slot picker: scrollable horizontal list on mobile

---

## SECTION 9: QUALITY GUARDRAILS

> Implement these checks to maintain platform quality

**Student-side limits:**
- Max 2 active Pending Meeting Requests at any time (prevent spam)
- Profile must be complete before booking
- Email must be verified before booking
- Phone verification recommended (shown as badge on student profile)

**University-side filters (optional per university):**
- Set eligible_degree_levels in Availability (e.g., Grad only)
- Set eligible_countries (e.g., only students from India, USA)
- Students outside filter → "This university is currently only accepting meetings from [criteria]. Check back later."

**Anti-spam:**
- Students cannot rebook same university within 24 hours of a cancelled meeting
- Universities cannot decline same student twice without admin review

---

---

## SECTION 11: TEST SCENARIOS (run all before going live)

```
✅ Student books → status = Pending → university gets email
✅ University accepts → status = Confirmed → both get confirmation + video link
✅ Student joins 10 min before → JOIN button activates
✅ Meeting ends → status auto = Completed → feedback emails sent
✅ Student cancels 5 hours before → status = Cancelled, is_late_cancel = no
✅ Student cancels 1 hour before → is_late_cancel = yes (logged)
✅ University proposes new time → student gets email → accepts → status = Confirmed
✅ No one joins → 15 min after start → status = No Show → admin alerted
✅ 24h reminder sent → reminder_24h_sent = yes → not sent again
✅ Student tries booking with incomplete profile → redirected to onboarding
✅ Student tries booking 3rd meeting while 2 pending → blocked with message
✅ External link copied correctly to Meeting Request on Confirm
✅ Time zones display correctly for student (their TZ) and rep (their TZ)
✅ Daily admin summary email arrives at 6pm with correct counts
✅ Mobile: complete booking flow works on iPhone Safari + Android Chrome
```

**THAT IS THE COMPLETE MEETING SYSTEM.**

**Build PHASE A first, test it, then move to B, C, D, E, F in order.**
**Do not build all phases at once — build and test incrementally.**
